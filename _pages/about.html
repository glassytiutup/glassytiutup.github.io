    <h3>Why I Started {{ site.name }}</h3>
    <p>I've always believed that beauty isn’t just about looking good, but also about feeling good in your own skin. After trying so many beauty products, watching endless tutorials, and learning through my own experiences, I decided to create <strong>{{ site.name }}</strong> to share what I've learned with others. Whether it’s a new makeup trick, skincare routine, or beauty hack, I want this blog to be a place where you can find easy, practical tips to enhance your natural beauty.</p>
